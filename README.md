# simple_BMI_calc
I created this simple BMI calculator to train my skills. 

It wasn't easy - I still don't know much about JS. I checked a lot in internet, but I tried to create my own functions and I didn't copy solutions.

CSS styles are 100% my imagination, same with HTML.

I spent a few hours on this project, on styling mostly hahaha.
